# 30-day-leetcode-challenge
In order to help us stay focussed whilst we're encouraged to stay home due to the COVID-19 epidemic, LeetCode is running the 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge for the month of April. 
This repo consists of my solutions to the problems I solved on each day. I wrote them in Python3.
All the problems can be found on LeetCode under the same name as that of my solution file. 
Most problems are of easy level of difficulty.
There is not code for taking user input in my solutions, since LeetCode handles that with it's test cases.
